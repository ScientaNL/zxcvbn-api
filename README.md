# i18n-api version of `zxcvbn`  üîê
[`original zxcvbn readme here`](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn)


#### Why:
We decided to build this web-api wrapper with i18n support because:
- `zxcvbn` is too large to use in client javascript (~400kb gzipped).
- It only had support for english names and words.

*This is only intended to run on a server, do not send this amount of data to your client.*

Languages at this time: `EN`, `FR`, `NL`.

Feel free to add any languages by pull request, or provide us with language datasets.

---

### Usage:

run `docker-compose up -d` to start the container on `localhost:3000`


#### Api usage:

```apib

### Improvements:

- All the langauges are included at the moment since there are only 3, when needed, it should use dynamic loading of the datasets.
- Better error handling
- Improve datasets
